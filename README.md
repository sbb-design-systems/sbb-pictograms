# sbb-pictograms

Pictogram repository for the SBB organization.

The `@sbb-esta/pictograms` npm package contains all SVG pictograms as files and provides a list of available
pictograms via root export.

## Local setup

To run the scripts locally you need to set `FIGMA_FILE_ID` and `FIGMA_TOKEN`. 
Assuming you have permissions to the pictogram Figma, you can create a token yourself in your personal account settings.
The Figma file id can be read from the url of the Figma file.
